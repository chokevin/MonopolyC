# MonopolyC 

This is monopoly for C++. This was coded for UH Manoa's EE 205 (Object Oriented Programming) class. 

## Classes

* Game (Handles all the intricacies of the Monopoly game)
* Player (Handles all the information for each player)
* Property (Handles the information and manipulation of information of each property)


## Future Development

* A GUI is currently in development with the QTGui library.
* This game did not take into account when Players run out of money... This still needs to be developed.
* Also Did not account for buying and selling of houses.
